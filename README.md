# CodeJam
The game, Space Game is made by Frederik Larsen, Emil Carstensen, Joshua Bussink, Mathias Claus Hagedorn & Mathias Nygaard Laursen.

Emil Carstensen made the ObejctMovement and contributed to everything else and made the GameManager and scenes.
Frederik Larsen made the BulletScript, PlayerShooter and the SoundManager.
Joshua Bussink made the SpawnManager.
Mathias Claus Hagedorn made the PlayerMovement.
Mathias Nygaard Laursen made the Sprites, normal maps, Health script, ammo script, setup the render pipeline and lighting and contributed to everything else.

Additionally I (Frederik Larsen) have added a jamming function after the game jam and improved on the playershooter to match a function like that.
I have also added comments on each section and try to implement new sounds to the soundmanager, but it didn't seem to work nor did unity give a error code for it.
